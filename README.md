# link-cleaner

a chrome extension for cleaning up url encoding from copied links

working, but just running in dev mode currently


#### using this extension

for example, a "dirty" link is pasted into the popup's text box:

`https://app.relateiq.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com`

the extenstion cleans up the encoded URL and removes the tracking prefix, outputting the much friendlier:

`https://www.example.com`
